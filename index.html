            I'm passionate about teaching front-end technologies and growing people in their careers.
            
            I have over 10 years of experience in the tech industry starting with helping small businesses develop apps. I transitioned from a Senior Developer to a Solution Architect, aka Staff Developer and then decided to transition to leadership. I have been leading teams and helped define the future of FinTech in Canada.
            
            Previously, I worked as a Senior Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Solution Architect, and Lead developer at companies such as WealthSimple, Loblaw Digital, Rangle.io, and IBM Canada. I have architected and scaled many web and mobile apps for clients using React, GraphQL, React Native and Next.js. You may know some of them: Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, Borrowell, WealthSimple, Moleskine and more.</p>

            <p>
                As a Chartered Engineer with a project management qualification and working experience in the
                pharmaceutical, oil &gas and nuclear sectors, I have over 15 years of experience in design,
                construction, multidiscipline project management and discipline leadership.
            </p>

            <p>
                Drawing on strong communicative and organisational abilities, I have developed skills essential to
                ensure effective strategic delivery in a dynamic environment, whilst maintaining focus on client
                expectations. In my current position as CS discipline manager, this delivery experience, gives me the
                advantage of understanding project requirements whilst managing the people focused elements of my role.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have lead a team of approximately 80 individuals across multiple locations in the UK, I put people
                development and teamwork at the forefront and make it my priority to establish successful professional
                relationships creating an environment for innovation and growth. My current role as Programme Manager
                for Global projects requires me to run teams globally, connect them and build products that will further
                enhance the running of the business.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a highly driven individual, I proactively seek out opportunities and new challenges to further my
                personal and professional development and have recently completed the final stages of an MSC in Business
                and Strategic Leadership at Cranfield University in which engagement, business strategy and
                organisational change were key areas which I have directly applied in leading the integration of
                separate teams through restructure and cultural change. I am a stong advocate for women in industry and
                a mentor for STEM students as part of my role. I have sucessfully assisted female students through years
                10, 11, 12 university and in the workplace.

            A Data Scientist / Engineer with 13 years‚Äô experience of delivering high quality and innovative BI

            Data Management ‚Ä¢ SQL ‚Ä¢ Python
        </p>
        My undergraduate degree gave me a solid foundation in data management and mathematics. I found an unexpected
        interest in data handling, connecting data mining with my approach to puzzle solving and engineering
        challenges. In recent years, I have become interested in emergent technologies, statistics, machine
        learning, and ethical data management. I am also a keen advocate for the democratisation of data, improving
        the quality of foundational data structures and driving data literacy initiatives. A favourite saying is
        that "An organisation that is good with data must comprise of people that are good with data". As such, I am
        currently studying toward an MSc in Data Science - due to complete in December 2022. Having varied interests
        outside of work, I maintain a strong connection to nature and sustainability. I work for Siemens Energy,
        where I support data driven decision making in the drive toward Green Energy.
