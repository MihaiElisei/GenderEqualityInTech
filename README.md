# **Solve The Gender Gap In Tech?**

## **Introduction**

This project aims to help address the gender gap issue of women in tech. Women are dropping out of tech and STEM subjects very early in their education. This project will allow women who are currently working in tech to volunteer their time to mentor girls and women who are currently studying tech and STEM subjects in high school and university.

<br/>

#### **2.1 Navbar** 

The Navbar we used is a standard Bootstrap Navbar. We chose this because it offers mobile responsiveness and as we don't have many pages on the project a simple Navbar will suffice. 

#### **2.2 Mentor cards**

The mentor card will detail information about the mentor who is volunteering their services on the site. The mentor card will include:

1. A title e.g. Engineering Mentor
2. The name of the mentor
3. An image of the mentor
4. The specialty of the mentor
5. The mentors current job description
6. A logo of the company they are employed by
7. A personal statement of the mentor to include current role, relevant work 
related experience.
8. A link button titled Be My Mentor which takes you to a form where you can
fill in your details to connect with the mentor. 
9. A link button titled Availability which takes you to the mentor calendar.
10. A card titled Education which includes most recent qualifications and logos
of the places of education.
11. A 2nd card titled Licenses, or skills if not applicable to include logos of 
education providers, the qualification skill and the name of the education 
provider.

#### **2.3 Student cards**

#### **2.4 Register as student/mentor**

#### **2.5 Women in tech stats**

The women in tec stats page shows data pulled from different sources. It shows users what countries are leading the way in addressing the gender gap issue. It also highlights how the shortage of women tech can be traced as far back as high school.

The page also shows how the field of computing used to be dominated by women and we also list how women can succeed in tech and we list some of the biggest tech organizations in the world that are headed by women. 

At the bottom of the page we have a number of videos where users can directly hear from women who are already working in the tech/STEM field. 

#### **2.6 Quiz**

#### **2.7 Footer**

* The footer is a basic bootstrap footer that contains the copywrite info and social media icons.
